The Authenticated Anonymity Architecture (AAA) is a blockchain-based solution designed to provide robust and ethical authenticated anonymous identities, enabling users to maintain anonymity while allowing for deanonymization in cases of criminal activity.

## Get Started

See [nip-backend](./nip-backend/README.md) and [contracts](./contracts/README.md) README.md files to start the system locally.

To deploy it on remote servers see the [Ansible](./infrastructure/README.md) guide.
